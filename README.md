 A new and improved suite of map projections based on a polydimensional mesh

## Data sources
 To run the `optimize_cuts.py` script, which locates and saves continental divides for use as interruptions, you will need the USGS EROS Center's global 30 arcsec elevation data set (GTOPO30, DOI: 10.5066/F7DF6PQS).  Download it as GeoTIF files and put it in data/elevation.  The script will load and assemble it automatically.
